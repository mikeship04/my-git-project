                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Hello my name is Mike Shippy, a 35 year old career changer from Phoenix Arizona.  After almost 20 years in the hospitality industry I was standing in a ballroom
                        on new years eve bartending a private event, instead of spending some much needed time with my family.  At this point I knew it was time for a change.  After a lot of research
                        and personal education on the matter I decided to get everything in order so I could attend the <strong>Flatiron School</strong>.  I listened to hundreds of episodes of
                        <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast" target="_blank">the code newbie podcast</a> and heard Saron interview countless inspiring people with similar stories and backgrounds
                        making the leap to better their situations.  Knowing I was not alone in my search for something greater and ever eager for a new challenge I made the choice to 
                        quit my job so I could focus on school full time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although I am still a newbie, this site will be continuously updated as I complete my curriculum at
                        Flatiron School to showcase my abilitiy to learn and execute.
