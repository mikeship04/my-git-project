            <p id="main_paragraph">Hello my name is Mike Shippy, a 35 year old career changer from Phoenix Arizona.  After almost 20 years in the hospitality industry I was standing in a ballroom
                on new years eve bartending a private event, instead of spending some much needed time with my family, and knew it was time for a change.  After a lot of research
                and personal education on the matter I decided to get everything in order so I could attend the Flatiron School.  I listened to hundreds of episodes of
                <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast">the code newbie podcast</a> and heard Saron interview countless inspiring people with similar stories and backgrounds
                making the leap to better their situations.  Armed with all the information to be successful it was time to dive into the deep end.
