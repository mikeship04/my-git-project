My Personal Website
This website was created at the end of prework with lots of additional eduaction specifically with CSS.

The way I went about this project was to first layout the HTML and define tags in a friendly way to make it easy to grab with CSS selectors.
Once the HTML was displayed I moved in sections to create "blocks" of CSS for each HTML element to be styled.
I found a color pallette and font style I enjoyed and then imported them via google fonts API.
I learned about HSL(a) "hue, saturation, lightness, (alpha or opacity)" in CSS and how they are created with %'s from a color wheel.
using the --define-color: 50%, 50%, 80% we can define our own colors to call on later in our CSS, this saves time when working with a custom palette.
